TODO List for bash ave:

1.  Set up sqlite3 database template
  a.  Currently, there's no sqlite3 database that has been uploaded to git
      and so there's nothing for the default bash_ave.sh script to send data
      to.

2.  Set up more support for verbose mode.
3.  Set up support for flags (-v for verbose)

COMPLETE  4.  Kiss my wife, because I'm showing this to her as an example.
